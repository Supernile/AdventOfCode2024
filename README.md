# AdventOfCode2024
Collection of Solutions to Advent Of Code 2024. I didn't complete the whole challenge in December but decided to use them throughout the year as fun problems to practice my coding. :)
The first three challenges were completed using C# and the rest were completed using C++.
Both parts are in the same file, separated as functions (Part1() for part 1 and Part2() for part 2). These return integers (sometimes long longs)
